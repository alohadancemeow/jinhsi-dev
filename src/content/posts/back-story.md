# Official Introduction

> Through repeated ages, the Lament has preyed upon mankind's vulnerable hope.
> Yet, grasping the nettle, she strives with all her might to forge a path toward tomorrow.


# Personality

A kindhearted and driven young girl, Jinhsi is an altruistic figure who cares deeply for those in Jinzhou. Since her youth, its been made clear that Jinhsi seeks for a peaceful world and strives to reach out for such an ideal. Being driven, she seeks out those who could support and aid her, such as her mentor, Changli, and isn't afraid to ask for help. Whenever she is presented with a problem, she muses over a solution, and is guided in helping those in need. Throughout her position as Magistrate, Jinhsi would always put others before her, holding no ulterior motives and only wishes to uphold her people's wishes and happiness. Being particularly compulsive to the point where at times she neglects her own health, causing some worry among those who care for her. Jinhsi's earnest wish to bring peace is enough that when faced with a crisis, such as the one coming from Mt. Firmament, she is willing to risk her own life. However, Jinhsi acclaims that while she may endanger herself, she would only do so as a last resort and is willing to find alternative solutions.

Jinhsi is also protective of those she has grown attached towards. From the people of Jinzhou, to Jué, whom she willingly defied if it meant ensuring the Sentinel's life is safe, having no desire for a solution that simply ends in death as the first proposal. Instead, she decides that defying fate and overcoming the odds as her preferable choice if it means she can protect all she cares for and lead Jinzhou into an age where the Sentinels may not be needed for constant defense. This outlook and her continuous actions in caring for others have thus garnered forth much respect, whereas before many had once doubted her due to her age.

### Forte Examination Report

Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2100-G]
The exact timing of Resonator Jinhsi's Awakening remains unclear. Signs of her Awakening manifested early in her life, establishing a profound resonance with Sentinel Jué.

Positioned at the midpoint of her back, Jinhsi's Tacet Mark is a distinct feature. When activating her Resonance Ability, crystalline formations resembling Loong horns materialize above her head.

Through her unique gift, Jinhsi can manipulate light to create holographic projections mirroring Sentinel Jué, showcasing power comparable to the Sentinel's own abilities.

Observational data points towards the exceptional growth capacity of Jinhsi's Resonance Ability. The pinnacle of this ability hints at the remarkable prospect of revitalizing stagnant time.

Detailed analysis of Jinhsi's Resonance Spectrum Pattern has unveiled a striking resemblance to that of Sentinel Jué. Rigorous testing has uncovered strong Syntony reactions. Nevertheless, the precise trigger behind Jinhsi's Awakening remains enigmatic due to the Sentinel's special position.

Analysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform, which classifies Jinhsi as a Congenital Resonator.

# Character Stories

-- Her Leadership: Unlocks at Intimacy Lv. 1

Jinzhou, on the borderlands, often conjures images of desolate lands and barren mountain ranges.

Once a merchant was tasked with a journey to Jinzhou. "I'm not well," he promptly refused. "I would die halfway if I were to go there." His colleague smiled and responded, "You'll know what it's like once you see it for yourself."

Reluctantly, the duo set out for Jinzhou. They traversed countless barren wastelands and perilous jungles until they finally reached a picturesque place embraced by lush mountains and clear water.

Standing at the end of the forest path were towering city gates. Soldiers on guard gave them a friendly welcome, granting them entry after a quick check of their papers.

A lively tapestry of life unfurled before them as they ventured into Jinzhou. Contrary to expectations, the city was a bustling hub of activity and lacked any trace of desolation or bleakness. Amidst well-designed buildings and serene ponds teeming with colorful carp, they discovered a captivating scenery that rivaled even the lush landscapes of inland regions. Lost in the lively atmosphere, they sampled Kungfu Tea at Liuxian Teahouse, savored the specialty dish at Panhua's Restaurant, and immersed themselves in the shows at Jinzhou Theater. With each experience, their weariness faded away, replaced by the invigorating energy of Jinzhou and the warm hospitality of its people.

"Unbelievable! Who would have thought a borderland city could thrive like this? It feels like a utopia. It must have taken a lot of hard work to create such beautiful structures in here."

"Our magistrate always preached the value of hard work. No matter your circumstances, with determination and effort, you can achieve your dreams. So despite the barren mountains and Tacet Discords, we built our homes and savored the good times before hardship struck."

"It's amazing how you all pulled it off. It couldn't have been easy, but each of you made it happen. Truly impressive."

"Well, it's not as tough as it seems with our great magistrate leading the way. We just follow her lead, and she takes care of everything here."

"Yeah, she seems really wise and capable. I bet she has years of experience too?"

"Nope, she's still young, only in her teens!"

"Teens?!"
